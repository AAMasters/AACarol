# I'm Carol, an AA e-Bot!

### My Specialty
I take a snapshot of order books of each market every minute, and store the info in separate files per market.

### Ideal for
My dataset is instrumental for identifying support and resistance levels, analyzing capital flows across markets, building indicators that require fresh and dynamic info about the positions traders are taking and their changes over time, etc.
